BigMart Sales Prediction
focuses on predicting sales for BigMart outlets using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help BigMart optimize inventory management and improve sales strategies by accurately forecasting future sales based on historical data.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed sales data to identify trends, handle missing values, and engineer relevant features.

Machine Learning Models: Implemented and evaluated multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation: Achieved 85% accuracy in sales predictions using optimized hyperparameters and cross-validation.

Data Visualization: Created visualizations to showcase insights and model performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Tools & Technologies
